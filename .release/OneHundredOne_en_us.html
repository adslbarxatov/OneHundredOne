<p>A pack of 36 cards is used. Each player is dealt 4 cards. The last card dealt is placed
on the table next to the remaining pack (i.e. the dealer makes the first turn). The next
player covers this card with one or more of the cards he has, depending on the situation
(see below). If there are no options, player can take one additional card from the pack.
If there are still no options, the player skips the turn.</p>
<p>Each next player does the same. If the cards in hand run out, the player is out
of the round. The round ends when there is only one person left at the table who has cards
in his hand. For a game of two, the exit of one player coincides with the end of the round.</p>
<p>The player’s penalty points are counted on the remaining cards. Also, according to the cards
with which the other players completed the round, their bonuses are determined. As a result,
if someone’s points exceed 101, he is considered a loser. If a player gets exactly 101
points, his penalty is reset to zero.</p>
<p>There are three ways to cover any card:</p>
<ul>
<li>a card of the same suit;</li>
<li>a card of the same denomination;</li>
<li>any <code>Queen</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of the <code>Queen</code>, the player is required to “order” the suit that will be most
convenient for him to continue the game. The opponent will have to cover the Queen with
a card of the ordered suit or another <code>Queen</code>.</p>
<p>Some cards oblige the opponent to skip a turn and/or draw additional cards from the pack.
This allows the player to build sometimes quite long chains and quickly get rid of cards.
These cards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>all <code>Aces</code> (the opponent skips one turn);</li>
<li>all <code>Sevens</code> (the opponent skips one turn and takes 1 card);</li>
<li>all <code>Sixes</code> (the opponent skips one turn and takes 2 cards);</li>
<li><code>King of Spades</code> (opponent skips one turn and takes 5 cards);</li>
<li>all <code>Eights</code> (the opponent skips the turn, but the player must cover the Eight using his
cards or drawing cards from the pack, even if his own have already run out).</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the cards after use require only the transition of the turn.</p>
<p>Penalty points are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>each <code>Six</code>, <code>Seven</code>, <code>Eight</code> and <code>Ten</code> add their denomination to the sum;</li>
<li><code>Jack</code> adds 2 points, <code>Queen</code> – 3, <code>King</code> – 4, <code>Ace</code> – 11;</li>
<li><code>Nines</code> don’t affect the score.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonuses are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a player exits the round by covering the card with the <code>Queen of Spades</code>, 40 points
are deducted from his penalty;</li>
<li>if the player goes out with any other <code>Queen</code>, 20 points are deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, players’ scores can be negative</p>
